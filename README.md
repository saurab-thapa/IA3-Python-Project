# AI-Powered Student Performance Analysis System

# Abstract

The AI-Powered Student Performance Analysis System is a software tool designed to help educational institutions monitor, analyze, and improve student academic outcomes. It leverages artificial intelligence and data analytics to provide actionable insights into student performance trends, subject-wise strengths and weaknesses, attendance impact, and overall academic health.

The system includes modules for attendance tracking, grade entry, behavior notes, and assignment scores. Using machine learning algorithms, it predicts future performance and alerts teachers about at-risk students. Data visualization tools help in interpreting the data through intuitive charts and reports.

Developed using Python with Tkinter for GUI, MySQL for the backend, and scikit-learn for AI, the application is user-friendly, scalable, and focused on educational impact. It supports PDF/Excel export for reports and integrates data security features for privacy.

This project not only streamlines academic monitoring but also assists educators in making data-driven decisions, ultimately enhancing the learning experience and student outcomes.
